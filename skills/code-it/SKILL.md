# Code It

## Goal

Implement the approved plan in `.ai/branches/{branch-slug}/plan.md` and commit the work as a new commit.

## Branch Scope

1. Resolve `branch-slug` from the active git branch:
   - Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
   - If the result is `HEAD`, use `detached-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)`.
   - Replace `/` with `_` in the final value.
2. Read planning artifacts from `.ai/branches/{branch-slug}`.
3. Do not read top-level `.ai/plan.md` unless migrating legacy data.

## Workflow

1. Read `.ai/branches/{branch-slug}/plan.md` fully before editing.
2. Implement plan steps in order, updating code, tests, and docs as required.
3. Run relevant checks and tests for changed areas.
4. Summarize what changed and what validation passed.
5. Ensure that tests and coding standards pass.
6. Create a new commit with a Conventional Commit message.

## Commit Rules

- Create a new commit, do not amend.
- Keep commit scope aligned with the plan.
- Use factual, concise commit text.
- Include a closes line if the commit closes a github issue.
- Sign the commit.

## Failure Handling

- If `.ai/branches/{branch-slug}/plan.md` is missing but legacy `.ai/plan.md` exists, copy legacy content once before implementation.
- If branch and legacy plan files are both missing, ask the user to run `plan-it` first.
